Enchancements:

1. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
2. Add special search lineedits to modal windows like "skip_tables".
3. Only first error flag not works.
4. Fix hanging of comparator on huge tables (like creative_page_position for irving).
5. Make default setting for mysql-port field.
6. Implement summary file.

Support dataframes roadmap:

0. Check correctness of day-summary mode.
1. Check correctness of section-summary mode.
2. Check correctness of detailed mode.
