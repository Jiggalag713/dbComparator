1. Define remoteids lists of target tables are equal? If have no remoteids - use ids.
2. If yes - read sql by chunks.
3. If no - fail checking and print excess numbers.



4. If primary key column elements differs - define uniq elements for both dataframes and exclude it from this dataframes
(with storing uniq elements to result).
5. Lists with identically primary-key elements we can compare by chuncks.
6. If there is no primary key in tables, we should come upp with algorythm of comparing such tables.
